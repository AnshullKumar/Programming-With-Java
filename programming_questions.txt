### Number-Based Questions
---

1.  **Prime Number Check:** Write a program to check if a given number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2.  **Palindrome Check:** Write a program to check if a given number or string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.

3.  **Binary Conversion:** Write a program to convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent.

4.  **Armstrong's Number:** Write a program to check if a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

5.  **Fibonacci Series:** Write a program to generate the Fibonacci series up to a given number of terms. The Fibonacci series is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
